You will need some hardware to make this webshell "pluggable". But you can try to run it and see what it does.

Use it

Once the script configured for your needs (take a look at the scripts comments), uploaded to the internet, and the Digispark programmed, you should be ready.

1. Plug the digispark into the computer which simulates the victim.
2. Wait a few seconds.
3. Open your phone, laptop, … and connect to the new access point.
4. Scan for the victims IP address inside the local network
5. Enterthe Ip address, followed by the port into the URL bar of your browser (e.g. 192.168.43.214:1338)

A wild webshell appears.
